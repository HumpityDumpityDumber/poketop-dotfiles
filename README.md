# PokeTop Hyprland Dotfiles

These dotfiles include:
- the poketop desktop shell and themer
- hyprland config with utility scripts
- zshrc
- gtk theme

Apps use gruvbox themes, the desktop is pokemon themed, and hyprland is nicely integrated with the ags shell.

zshrc shows current pokemon along with having nice autofill features.

install script also has the option to also install all of my prefered applications in addition to the packages required by the dotfiles.

by default the dependencies are:
- grimblast
- hyprpicker
- hypridle
- wtype
- qalculate
- pipewire
- pavucontrol
- swww
- pokemon-colorscripts
